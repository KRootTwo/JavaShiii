//If you have N eggs, then you have N/12 dozen eggs, with N%12 eggs left over. (This
//is essentially the definition of the / and % operators for integers.)
//Write a Java Program that asks the user how many eggs she has and then tells the user
//how many dozen eggs she has and how many extra eggs are left over.
//A gross of eggs is equal to 144 eggs. Extend your program so that it will tell the user
//how many gross, how many dozen, and how many left over eggs she has.
